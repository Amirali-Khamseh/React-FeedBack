# Feedback system 
The Feedback system is a modern React application that enables users to share their opinions and experiences regarding a product or service. It allows users to rate the product or service using numbers and leave comments. The application is built using a component-based architecture, which makes it easy to integrate with other web applications and provide a rating system solution to those systems.

# Technical objectives
This React application is designed with a focus on component-based architecture. It uses the Context API to manage global state and facilitate communication between components based on their side effects. The application also features real-time data validation for user inputs, and generates statistics based on overall ratings.
